<p>
    
</p>The <b>COVID-<i>19</i></b> pandemic, also known as the coronavirus pandemic, is an ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease <i>2019</i> (<b>COVID-<i>19</i></b>) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus <i>2</i> (SARS-CoV-<i>2</i>). The novel virus was first identified from an outbreak in Wuhan, China, in December <i>2019</i>. Attempts to contain it there failed, allowing the virus to spread to other areas of China and later worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern on <i>30</i> January <i>2020</i> and a pandemic on 11 March 2020. As of 24 August 2022, the pandemic had caused more than 598 million cases and 6.46 million confirmed deaths, making it one of the deadliest in history.<br><br>

<b>COVID-19</b> symptoms range from undetectable to deadly, but most commonly include fever, dry cough, and fatigue. Severe illness is more likely in elderly patients and those with certain underlying medical conditions. <b>COVID-19</b> transmits when people breathe in air contaminated by droplets and small airborne particles containing the virus. The risk of breathing these in is highest when people are in close proximity, but they can be inhaled over longer distances, particularly indoors. Transmission can also occur if contaminated fluids reach the eyes, nose or mouth, and, rarely, via contaminated surfaces. Infected persons are typically contagious for 10 days, and can spread the virus even if they do not develop symptoms. Mutations have produced many strains (variants) with varying degrees of infectivity and virulence.<sup>[5][6]</sup>
